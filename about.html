        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>
          I was born in 1991 in southern England. I have been living in Spain for 9 years now. When I was 8 years old I
          started racing karts. My main interests are languages, Cricket, windsurfing and music.

        <p>
          After giving up karting because it was too expensive I was encouraged to find a different hobby. I
          chose Cricket and Music. I learnt the drums, then a few years later I
          started learning the guitar and bass. I was very interested in
          songwriting. This lead me to create a homestudio in my bedroom. I have
          an album out on spotify.

          As shown in the homepage I play the drums and I have a band here in
          Valencia. We should be playing on the 18th of June in a liverpool bar
          Russafa Valencia. Here are a few more videos.

          Together with learning Music I also took up Cricket. I managed to play
          at a high level when I was between the ages of 15 to 18. I was the
          captain of my youth cricket team. This was a great experience and
          taught me how to lead and manage a team.

          to learn many things and prepare myself to obtain a job in this
          industy and to continue growing as a professional software developer.
