    <h1>About me</h1>

<p> I was born in 1991 in southern England. When I was 8 years old I started racing karts.
     Cars and racing is one of my passions and I was lucky enough to have a short career racing
    Unfortunately racing is a rich mans game and I had to give up when I was 11 because my parents
     couldnt afford to keep going. Although I did manage to win a few championships in my time. see photo below.</p>

<div class="container"></div>
     <p>After giving up karting I was encouraged to find a different hobby. I chose Cricket and Music. I learnt the drums, 
         then a few years later I started learning the guitar and bass. I was very interested in songwriting. This lead me to 
         create a homestudio in my bedroom. I have an album out on spotify. 
         <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/58xT4CsxiXP15RMZx6VZC1" target="_blank">Spotify Alex Tebbitt.</a>
        As shown in the homepage I play the drums and I have a band here in Valencia. We should be playing on the 18th of June in a 
         liverpool bar Russafa Valencia. Here are a few more videos.   </p>

<p> Together with learning Music I also took up Cricket. I managed to play at a high level when I was between the ages of 15 to 18.
    I was the captain of my youth cricket team. This was a great experience and taught me how to lead and manage a team.   </p>
