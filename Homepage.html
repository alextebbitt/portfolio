          Hello, my name is Alex Tebbitt. I am currently undergoing a career
          change in this website you will find out about my previous work
          experience, the skills I have learnt in my previous career and the
          skills I have learnt concerning my new carreer as a software
          developer. As you might be able to guess from the picture below that I

          For the last 12 years I have been working as a teacher. Those years
          have been split between teaching at a school in Valencia (The British
          school of Valencia). Between 2017 and 2020 I was a primary school
          teacher. Teaching year 5 & 6. (ages 9-12)

          In 2016 & 2020 to 2022 I have been working on a project I had always
          wanted to do. I have always been very interested in learning
          languages. When I was doing my teaching training qualification, I
          started to write my own method for learning languages. It is an
          interchangeble language teaching method. This means it can be
          translated to various different languages. It started with English and
          Spanish. and has extended to Portuguese, Italian and French. I have
          been giving private and group classes using my method for 3 years now.
          This project has evolved into online video courses, where you can
          follow the method without a teacher at home. For this I needed to
          create a website. This meant I had to dive into the world of web
          design. At first I created a website with my online English and
          Spanish language courses using Wordpress. <br />
          <a href="www.valinguahouse.com" target="_blank"
            >www.valinguahouse.com</a
          >
          <br />
          I was fairly proud of myself at first but quickly I wanted to make it
          look more professional. This lead me to dive deeper into the world of
          coding and computer languages. I have very much been hook ever since
          and I am looking forward to continue growing as a software engineer.

          Before this I was working as a music teacher. Mainly teaching drums,
          bass guitar, guitar and music history. I am also in a band in
          Valencia. Below are some videos of my band playing on the Valingua
          house youtube channel.
